These requirements must be satisfied:
* Each white pixel represents a path (1px wide), a black pixel represents a wall (1px wide).
* The borders must be walls.
* One entry (path) on the top border.
* One exit (path) on the bottom border.

The output will be the same image with more colors:
* Orange are the paths explored.
* Red is the solution found.
